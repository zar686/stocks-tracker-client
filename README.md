## Planning Story

I traded stocks for couple of years and entering the stock info in Microsoft
excel. It ended up like spending hours entering each and every cell with information.
I googled for application that might help to log and keep track of stocks. I decided
to use this opporttunity to design this app to make sure loggin in information
becomes esay and not time consuming.
